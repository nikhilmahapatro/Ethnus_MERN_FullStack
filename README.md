# Ethnus MERN Full Stack Project

This project is a collection of frontend and backend applications built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It was developed as part of the Ethnus full-stack training program to demonstrate key concepts in building scalable, full-featured web applications.

## What's Included

- **React Frontend**: Basic component structure, routing, form handling, and Axios integration.
- **Node.js + Express Backend**: API creation, routing, request handling, and integration with MongoDB.
- **MongoDB Database**: Used for storing and retrieving user data.
- **REST API Implementation**: Covers CRUD operations for common use cases.
- **Sample Apps**:
  - Counter App
  - Todo App
  - Registration/Login
  - Simple Data Fetch and Display
- **Component-Based UI Design** using functional components and hooks

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to set up a MERN development environment
- Connecting frontend and backend via API endpoints
- Building reusable UI components with React
- Managing application state with React hooks
- Structuring an Express server and routing logic
- Interacting with MongoDB using Mongoose
- Basic form validation and user input handling


## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/Ethnus_MERN_FullStack`

2. Install dependencies  
   - Frontend:  
     ```
     cd client  
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - Backend:  
     ```
     cd server  
     npm install  
     node index.js
     ```

3. Make sure MongoDB is running locally or update the MongoDB URI in the backend config.

## Notes

- This repo is meant for learning and experimentation, not production.
- Each sub-app (e.g., todo, counter) demonstrates a specific concept.

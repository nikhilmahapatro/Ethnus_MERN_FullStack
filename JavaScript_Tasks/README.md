# JavaScript Tasks

This folder contains beginner to intermediate-level JavaScript practice files, each focused on solving a specific problem or UI behavior using plain JavaScript. These tasks are standalone `.html` files with embedded `<script>` tags—no frameworks or external libraries.

## What’s Inside

- A set of `.html` files named by task (e.g., task1.html, task2.html)
- Core JavaScript concepts applied in the browser:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling (click, input, etc.)
  - Functions and control flow
  - Form validation
  - Timers and simple interactivity

## What You’ll Learn

- Writing and linking JavaScript inside an HTML document
- Accessing and modifying DOM elements
- Responding to user input and browser events
- Implementing logic using conditionals, loops, and functions
- Building interactive behavior without libraries

## How to Run

Open any `.html` file directly in your browser.

Everything runs locally with no setup or installations needed.

## Notes

- These tasks focus on understanding pure JavaScript behavior in the browser
- No frameworks or build tools used
- Great for building core programming habits before moving to frameworks like React

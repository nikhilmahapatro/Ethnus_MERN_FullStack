# CSS Tasks

This folder contains a series of pure HTML and CSS projects aimed at building foundational skills in web styling. Each task is a standalone HTML file that tackles a specific layout, visual effect, or component design using core CSS properties and selectors—no frameworks involved.

## What’s Inside

- Multiple `.html` files representing different UI layout tasks
- Each task demonstrates use of CSS for:
  - Positioning (flexbox, float, etc.)
  - Styling buttons, forms, tables
  - Basic animations or transitions (where used)
  - Custom layouts without Bootstrap or grid libraries

## What You’ll Learn

- Writing clean, structured CSS from scratch
- Using CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, and units effectively
- How to control spacing, alignment, and layout visually
- Building responsive-ish pages using media queries (if applied)
- Developing design intuition through repetition

## How to Run

No setup needed. Open any `.html` file in a web browser.

These are standalone files using local styles (inline or internal CSS).

## Notes

- These are practice exercises focused purely on frontend fundamentals
- No JavaScript or external stylesheets used
- Great for building CSS muscle memory before moving to frameworks

# User Form with MongoDB (MERN Task)

This task is a basic full-stack CRUD app built using the MERN stack. It allows users to submit a form with their name and email, which is then stored in a MongoDB database. The stored data is fetched and displayed on the same page.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

## Features

- User form with name and email fields
- Submits data to backend via Axios
- Backend saves the data to MongoDB
- Displays all users from the database
- Refresh-free update using React state

## What You’ll Learn

- Connecting a React frontend to a MongoDB backend
- Using Axios for POST and GET requests
- Structuring Express routes for CRUD operations
- Managing state and re-rendering in React
- Using Mongoose for database schema and operations

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**

2. **Navigate to the task folder**

3. **Start the backend**

4. **Start the frontend**

5. Make sure MongoDB is running locally (or update your MongoDB URI in the backend config)

6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Notes

- No authentication — this is an open CRUD form
- Useful as a starter template for building real-world form-based apps
- You can extend it with delete/edit features to make it a full CRUD app

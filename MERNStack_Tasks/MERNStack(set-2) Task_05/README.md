# User Registration Form with MongoDB (MERN Task)

This task is a full-stack user registration app using the MERN stack. It captures user details via a form, stores them in MongoDB, and displays all registered users on the same page.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

## Features

- Registration form with username and password fields
- Submits user data to backend via Axios
- Backend stores data in MongoDB
- Fetches and displays all registered users
- Frontend refreshes automatically after submission

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to build and handle React forms
- Sending and receiving data with Axios
- Creating Express routes for POST and GET operations
- Using Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB collection
- Updating UI after server interaction

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Navigate to this task folder**

3. **Start the backend**

4. **Start the frontend**

5. Make sure MongoDB is running locally, or configure your connection string in the backend.

6. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Notes

- This is a learning-focused project, not meant for production use
- Passwords are stored in plain text (not secure)
- Useful as a foundation for building real-world registration/login flows

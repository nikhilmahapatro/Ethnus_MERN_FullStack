# Calculator App (MERN Task)

This is a full-stack calculator app built using the MERN stack. The frontend provides a simple interface for entering two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The backend processes the calculation and sends back the result.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: None  

## Features

- Inputs for two numbers and a dropdown to select the operation
- API call to backend on form submission
- Result displayed dynamically after backend response
- Simple, functional layout for practicing full-stack request handling

## What You’ll Learn

- How to build a controlled form in React
- Sending data from frontend to backend via POST request
- Handling arithmetic logic in Express
- Returning JSON responses to the frontend
- Maintaining clear separation of concerns between client and server

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

3. **Start the backend**

4. **Start the frontend**

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Notes

- No database is used — it's a stateless calculation app
- Keep an eye on input validation (e.g., divide by zero not handled by default)
- A good starter template for learning client-server communication

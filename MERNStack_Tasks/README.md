# MERN Stack Tasks

This folder includes hands-on projects built using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Each task focuses on connecting the full web development flow: frontend to backend to database.

These tasks are designed to give practical experience with API creation, data flow, user interaction, and basic CRUD operations.

## What’s Inside

- Full-stack mini projects using:
  - **React** for frontend UI and interaction
  - **Node.js + Express** for backend routing and API logic
  - **MongoDB** as the database for persistent storage
- Common features like:
  - Form handling and data submission
  - Axios-based API calls
  - Basic authentication flows (where implemented)
  - MongoDB operations via Mongoose

## What You’ll Learn

- How frontend and backend communicate through HTTP requests
- Structuring a full-stack app from scratch
- Writing RESTful APIs using Express
- Connecting Node.js apps to MongoDB databases
- Managing React state and side effects using hooks
- Debugging data flow across the stack

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**

2. **Navigate to any task directory** inside `/MERNStack_Tasks`

3. **Start the backend**
   
4. **Start the frontend**

> Make sure MongoDB is running locally or update the connection string in the backend config.

## Notes

- These tasks are kept modular and simple — ideal for understanding one concept at a time
- Focus is on clarity and learning, not production-ready structure
- Each task can be expanded into a more advanced project later

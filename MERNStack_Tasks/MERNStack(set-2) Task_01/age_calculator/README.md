- Displays age in years, months, and days
- Basic validation for invalid or future dates

## What You’ll Learn

- How to send user input from React to Express via Axios
- Server-side logic and date manipulation
- Structuring a full-stack app even when no database is needed
- Keeping frontend and backend in sync

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**

2. **Go to the age_calculator directory**

3. **Start the backend**

4. **Start the frontend**

5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

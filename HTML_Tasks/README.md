# HTML Tasks

This folder contains a set of beginner-friendly HTML-only practice files. Each task is designed to help you get comfortable with basic HTML structure, tags, and semantics. These tasks don’t use CSS or JavaScript—just raw HTML to focus on structure and content.

## What’s Inside

- `.html` files for each task (task1.html, task2.html, etc.)
- Focus areas include:
  - Basic page structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
  - Forms, input fields, tables, lists
  - Headings, paragraphs, links, images
  - Semantic elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, etc.

## What You’ll Learn

- How to structure a valid HTML document
- Common HTML tags and their attributes
- Building accessible forms and tables
- Linking between pages and embedding content
- Writing semantic and readable HTML

## How to Run

Just open any `.html` file in your browser.  
No setup or dependencies required.

## Notes

- These files are for practice and learning purposes only
- No styling or scripting is used—this is purely about markup
- Good starting point before layering on CSS and JS
